# React useEffect Hook State Update Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in React's useEffect hook: directly updating a state variable instead of using the state setter function.

## Bug Description
The `MyComponent` component uses the `useEffect` hook to increment the `count` state variable. However, it attempts to directly modify `count` instead of using `setCount`. This results in the component not re-rendering, and the UI not updating to reflect the change in state.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected implementation: using the `setCount` function to update the `count` state variable. This ensures that the component re-renders when the state changes, resulting in the correct UI update.
